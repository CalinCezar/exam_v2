## Project Overview

This repository contains the examination submission for the **Coupon Acceptance Prediction Problem**, which aims to predict whether a customer will accept a given coupon based on their personal, contextual, and behavioral features.

The notebook includes:
- Comprehensive **data preprocessing and cleaning**
- **Feature engineering** using frequency-based activity scores
- **Model training and selection** using multiple ML algorithms
- **Explainability analysis** through **SHAP visualizations**
- Evaluation based on metrics such as **AUC**, **accuracy**, and **classification report**

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment (Python **3.13.4** recommended):

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate      # On Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Highlights

End-to-End ML Pipeline: Integrated feature engineering, encoding, scaling, and model comparison.

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM.

Model Explainability: SHAP summary, dependence, and waterfall plots used to interpret model predictions.

Robust Evaluation: Based on AUC, accuracy, and classification metrics for fair comparison.
